    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we cover the basics of Xarray data structures. Our\n",
    "learning goals are as follows. By the end of the lesson, we will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the basic data structures (`DataArray` and `Dataset` objects) in Xarray\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-dimensional (a.k.a. N-dimensional, ND) arrays (sometimes called “tensors”)\n",
    "are an essential part of computational science. They are encountered in a wide\n",
    "range of fields, including physics, astronomy, geoscience, bioinformatics,\n",
    "engineering, finance, and deep learning. In Python, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)\n",
    "provides the fundamental data structure and API for working with raw ND arrays.\n",
    "However, real-world datasets are usually more than just raw numbers; they have\n",
    "labels which encode information about how the array values map to locations in\n",
    "space, time, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how we might structure a dataset for a weather forecast:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/_images/dataset-diagram.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"80%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice multiple data variables (temperature, precipitation), coordinate\n",
    "variables (latitude, longitude), and dimensions (x, y, t). We'll cover how these\n",
    "fit into Xarray's data structures below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Xarray doesn’t just keep track of labels on arrays – it uses them to provide a\n",
    "powerful and concise interface. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply operations over dimensions by name: `x.sum('time')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select values by label (or logical location) instead of integer location:\n",
    "  `x.loc['2014-01-01']` or `x.sel(time='2014-01-01')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mathematical operations (e.g., `x - y`) vectorize across multiple dimensions\n",
    "  (array broadcasting) based on dimension names, not shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easily use the split-apply-combine paradigm with groupby:\n",
    "  `x.groupby('time.dayofyear').mean()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database-like alignment based on coordinate labels that smoothly handles\n",
    "  missing values: `x, y = xr.align(x, y, join='outer')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep track of arbitrary metadata in the form of a Python dictionary:\n",
    "  `x.attrs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The N-dimensional nature of xarray’s data structures makes it suitable for\n",
    "dealing with multi-dimensional scientific data, and its use of dimension names\n",
    "instead of axis labels (`dim='time'` instead of `axis=0`) makes such arrays much\n",
    "more manageable than the raw numpy ndarray: with xarray, you don’t need to keep\n",
    "track of the order of an array’s dimensions or insert dummy dimensions of size 1\n",
    "to align arrays (e.g., using np.newaxis).\n",
    "\n",
    "The immediate payoff of using xarray is that you’ll write less code. The\n",
    "long-term payoff is that you’ll understand what you were thinking when you come\n",
    "back to look at it weeks or months later.\n"
