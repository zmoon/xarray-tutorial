# Creating new backends

## Introduction

You can [read different type of files](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/user-guide/io.html)) in `xr.open_dataset` by specifying the engine to be used:

```python
import xarray as xr
xr.open_dataset("my_file.grib" , engine="cfgrib")
```

For each available egine there is an underlying backend, that reads the data and pack them in a dataset.

Xarray bundles several backends internally for the following formats:

- netcdf4 - netCDF4
- scipy - netCDF3
- zarr - Zarr
- pydap - DAP
- ...

External Backends that use the new backend API (xarray >= v0.18.0) that allows to add support for backend without any change to Xarray

- [cfgrib](https://github.com/ecmwf/cfgrib) - GRIB
- [tiledb](https://pythonrepo.com/repo/TileDB-Inc-TileDB-xarray) - TileDB
- [rioxarray](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/stable/) - GeoTIFF, JPEG-2000, ESRI-hdr, etc (via GDAL)
- [xarray-sentinel](https://github.com/bopen/xarray-sentinel) - Sentinel-1 SAFE
- ...

## Why using the Xarray backend API

- Your users don't need to learn a new interface that is they can use `xr.open_dataset` with `engine` kwarg.
- With little extra effort you can have lazy loading with Dask. you have to implement a function for reading blocks and Xarray will manage lazy loading with Dask for you
- It's easy to implement: you don't need to integrate any code in Xarray
